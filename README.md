# aem-component-node-to-excel

This is just a tool for my work efficiency.
It generates an excel table from AEM(adobe experience manager) component node.
AEM component node is just a xml, so this program can be used for a not aem job with some fixes.
It might help someone...

There are 2 ways of reading xml.
* from local xml file.
* if you've started an aem server at your local machine, it can get xml from the server.
